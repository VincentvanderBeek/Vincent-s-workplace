Day 1

2) Foundations of AI
2.1 What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a rapid rise in popularity. Research into the field of AI is rocketing, and an increasing number of companies are incorporating AI technologies into their daily business operations. But, what does AI constitute?

The simulation of human intellectual functions by machines, particularly computer systems, is referred to as artificial intelligence. Expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine vision are some examples of specific AI applications.

2.1b How would you define 'artificial intelligence'?

the concept and creation of computer systems that can carry out tasks that would typically need human understanding, like speech recognition, language translation, and visual perception.

2.1c Give three examples of AI applications. You can choose real-life examples, but also examples from popular culture (e.g., movies, books, video games etc.).

AI in the generation of a sandbox, the area a player moves in that can be generated. Think about fields, caves, structures (video games)
AI in the sense of other agents in a video game, better known as a NPC. This could be a ally or enemy, and their behavior towards you and reacting to the players decisions/movement 
AIn recognition of creatures, what is considered a certain pet or animal in a vide that can be recommended to you because you really like cats 


2.2b Define the following terms: 'weak AI', and 'strong AI'.



2.2d What is the 'Chinese room experiment'? Describe its procedure.

2.2e What is the 'Chinese room experiment' supposed to show? Select the correct statement, and elaborate on your choice:

a) Computers are not yet able to simulate the human ability to understand
b) Understanding involves more than the ability to formally reproduce appropriate outputs
c) It is only possible for systems to demonstrate understanding
d) No machine can demonstrate genuine understanding

2.2f Connect the Post It notes (Fig 2.) to the relevant quadrant in the philosophy matrix (Fig 3.). For example, A = 1, 2, and B = 3, 4, 5 etc. Elaborate on your choices.
