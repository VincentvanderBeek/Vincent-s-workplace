1) History of Artificial Intelligence
1.1 Timeline
The early beginnings of AI, can be traced to the Ancient Greek period when philosophers started to describe human thinking as a symbolic system. Additionally, one of the first notions of a 'robot' can be found in Greek mythology:
THE FIRST ‚ÄúROBOT‚Äù to walk the earth‚Äîin ancient Greek mythology‚Äî was a bronze giant called Talos. Talos was an animated statue that guarded the island of Crete, one of three wondrous gifts fashioned by Hephaestus, god of the forge and patron of invention and technology.
These marvels were commissioned by Zeus, for his son, Minos, the legendary first king of Crete. The other two gifts were a golden quiver of drone-like arrows that never missed their mark and Laelaps, a golden hound that always caught its prey. The bronze automaton Talos was charged with the task of defending Crete against pirates. 
Talos patrolled Minos‚Äôs kingdom by marching around the perimeter of the large island three times each day. As an animated metal machine in the form of a man, able to carry out complex human-like actions, Talos can be spoken of as an imagined android robot, an automaton ‚Äúconstructed to move on its own.‚Äù 
Designed and built by Hephaestus to repel invasions, Talos was ‚Äúprogrammed‚Äù to spot strangers and pick up and hurl boulders to sink any foreign vessels that approached Crete‚Äôs shores. 
Talos possessed another capability too, modeled on a human trait. In close combat, the mechanical giant could perform a ghastly perversion of the universal gesture of human warmth, the embrace. 
With the ability to heat his bronze body red-hot, Talos would hug victims to his chest and roast them alive. (Mayor, 2018) 
Throughout the centuries, scholars from various disciplines have made significant contributions to the field of AI. To name a few of them: al-Jazari, Leonardo Da Vinci, Ada Lovelace, Norbert Wiener, and Alan Turing.
However, the field of 'artificial intelligence' was not formally founded until 1956. It was at a conference, held at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, were John McCarthy first coined the term 'artificial intelligence', which he defined as '... the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs' (Source).

After some setbacks in the 1970s and 1980s, also referred to as the AI winters, the field of AI has seen rapid advancements due to, among others, the introduction of deep learning, big data and artificial general intelligence in the early 2000s.

Tip: If you are having difficulties reading the mathematical equations or understanding the main concept of a scholarly text, try to look for additional information online. YouTube (e.g., Two Minute Papers), StackOverfow, Quora, and Medium are examples of webpages that can help you in analysing these sources of information.
1.2d Describe the procedure, and main objective of Turing's 'Imitation Game'. Write your answer down

3) DataLab preparation (Week 1, DataLab 1)
 Go to BUas' metasearch engine, and find:
A study skills book (e.g., presenting, writing, etc.) from the Library Collection
An AI-related eBook from the Library Collection.
Open your [YourName_BlockA_DataLabPreparation] markdown file, and write down the title, author(s), accession number and publication year. Commit the changes, and push the markdown file to your personal BUas repository.

https://www.buas.nl/library/library-metasearch

 Fill in your Work Log.
 Set a goal for Week 1, and note it down in your Learning Log.
Note: When you are finished with the independent study material, and still have some time left, try to apply your newly gained knowledge to the Creative Brief.
