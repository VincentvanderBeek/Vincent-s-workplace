2) Data analysis methods

2e Come up with at least one situation, where you could deploy a descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis. Elaborate on your answer.

Descriptive: 

A phone made by apple/samsung/oneplus: Gives insight into the situation it is looked at, with that you can assess if things are going well or can be improved to get better results


Diagnostic: 

In a factory creating chemical products: You want for the most part to go according to plan. With a diagnostic analysis you keep track if everything goes right and it keeps creating the product that is sought after.


Predictive: 

Investment in stocks: This is the most risk free way to make decisions without knowing a definite answer. Predicting with all the information you can get gives you a percentage in which you can choose the most comfortable action

Prescriptive:  

Medical advice: Everyone has to get medicine once in a while so pharmacists will try the prescribe you the best medicine you can get according to what they know about you or the problems that are present.

2f Power BI is one of the most popular dashboarding tools. List another dashboarding tool, and provide at least one 'strength' and 'weakness'. Write your answer down.

Dashboard: Tableau Public is part of the Tableau software portfolio that offers three different software choices: Tableau Public, Tableau Reader and Tableau Desktop

Strength:

Tableau can handle millions of rows of data with ease. Different types of visualization can be created with a large amount of data without impacting the performance of the dashboards.
Using drag-n-drop functionalities of Tableau, the user can create a very interactive visual within minutes. The interface can handle endless variations while also limiting you from creating charts that are against data visualization best practices. 
Tableau Dashboard has a great reporting feature that allows you to customize dashboard specifically for a certain device such as a mobile phone or laptop. 


Weakness:

Tableau does not provide the feature of automatic refreshing of the reports with the help of scheduling.
Tableauâ€™s parameters are static and always single value can be selected using a parameter. Whenever the data gets changed, these parameters need to be updated manually every time. 
Tableau is strictly a visualization tool. Tableau Desktop allows you do to very basic preprocessing. This includes joining and blending data. Also, you have the ability to change data types.

2g In Week 4, you will start to develop your own dashboard with Power BI. In our program, we stimulate self-directed learning, which includes setting your own goals, and identifying relevant sources of information (in the first two years under supervision of a teaching staff member). Let start with the latter; find at least three useful Power BI resources for your Block A project (e.g., books, online tutorials, etc.). List the resources (, and share them with your peers via a post in Microsoft Teams' 'Coffee Corner').
